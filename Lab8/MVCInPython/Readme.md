# To run project on your pc
To run a Django project that you've cloned from GitHub, you'll need to follow these steps. This includes setting up the project on your local machine, installing dependencies, and running the development server. Below is a step-by-step guide to running a Django project from GitHub.

### **Step 1: Clone the Project from GitHub**

1. **Install Git** (if you don’t already have it installed):
   - You can download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Clone the GitHub repository**:
   Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Use the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```
   Replace `username/repository-name` with the appropriate GitHub repository URL.

3. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

### **Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment**

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing project dependencies.
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\.venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

   When the virtual environment is activated, your terminal prompt should change, showing the environment name, like `(.venv)`.

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**

Once your virtual environment is activated, you need to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. This file is usually found in the root directory of the project and contains the necessary packages for the project.

1. **Install dependencies**:
   If the project has a `requirements.txt` file, run the following command to install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If the `requirements.txt` file doesn’t exist but the project is set up with `poetry` or `pipenv`, you can install dependencies using those tools (e.g., `pipenv install` or `poetry install`).

### **Step 4: Set Up the Database**

1. **Create Database Migrations**:
   Django uses migrations to set up your database schema. Run the following command to create migration files for any database changes:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

2. **Apply Migrations**:
   To apply the migrations and set up your database schema, run:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Create a Superuser** (Optional):
   To access Django’s admin panel, you need to create a superuser account:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   Follow the prompts to create the superuser account (username, email, and password).

### **Step 5: Run the Development Server**

Now that you've set up the environment, installed dependencies, and applied migrations, you can run the development server to check the project.

1. **Run the server**:
   To start the Django development server, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   By default, the server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can open this URL in your browser to view the project.

2. **Access the Admin Panel** (Optional):
   If you created a superuser, you can log in to Django's admin panel by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` in your browser and using the superuser credentials you created.

### **Step 6: Verify the Project Runs Correctly**

After following the steps above, check the following:

1. **Check if the project is running**:
   Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to ensure the Django project is running and that you can see the homepage or other views defined in the project.

2. **Access the Admin Panel** (if applicable):
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in using the superuser credentials you created earlier.

### **Troubleshooting**

- **Missing `requirements.txt`**:
  If the repository doesn’t have a `requirements.txt` file, check if there is any other way to install dependencies. Look for `Pipfile`, `poetry.lock`, or any documentation (like a `README.md`) for instructions.

- **Database Errors**:
  If the database migration or connection fails, make sure the correct database settings are provided in `settings.py` (like database name, username, password, and host). If you're using SQLite (default in Django), the database file will be created automatically when running migrations.

- **Permission Errors**:
  If you encounter permission errors during any of these steps, try running the terminal as an administrator (Windows) or using `sudo` (macOS/Linux). However, avoid using `sudo` unless absolutely necessary for Python package installations.

---

### **Summary**

To run a Django project from GitHub:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Apply database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
5. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`
6. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to check if everything is working.

Below is the implementation of a simple **Bookstore Project** using Django with the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern, along with a **layered architecture**. This project will allow users to view a list of books, and in the admin panel, you can manage book entries (add, edit, delete).

---

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **Step 1: Set Up the Environment**

1. **Install Python and Create Virtual Environment**

   If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

   Then, create a virtual environment and activate it.

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     .\.venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install Django**

   Inside the activated virtual environment, install Django:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Create the Django Project and App**

1. **Create a Django Project** called `bookstore_project`:
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject bookstore_project
   cd bookstore_project
   ```

2. **Create a Django App** called `books`:
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp books
   ```

3. **Add the `books` app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `bookstore_project/settings.py`:**

   Open `bookstore_project/settings.py` and add `'books'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       'django.contrib.admin',
       'django.contrib.auth',
       'django.contrib.contenttypes',
       'django.contrib.sessions',
       'django.contrib.messages',
       'django.contrib.staticfiles',
       'books',  # Add this line
   ]
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Define the Model (Data Layer)**

1. In `books/models.py`, define a `Book` model with fields like title, author, description, and price.

   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class Book(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
       author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
       description = models.TextField()
       price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
       published_date = models.DateField()

       def __str__(self):
           return self.title
   ```

2. **Apply Migrations** to create the `Book` table in the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations books
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Register the Model in Admin (Optional)**

To manage books via Django's admin interface, you need to register the `Book` model in `books/admin.py`.

1. Open `books/admin.py` and add the following code:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from .models import Book

   admin.site.register(Book)
   ```

2. **Create a Superuser** to access the Django admin:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to create a superuser account.

---

### **Step 5: Create Views (Controller Layer)**

In Django, views handle user requests and return appropriate responses. We’ll create a view to list books.

1. Open `books/views.py` and create a simple view that retrieves all books and displays them:

   ```python
   from django.shortcuts import render
   from .models import Book

   def book_list(request):
       books = Book.objects.all()
       return render(request, 'books/book_list.html', {'books': books})
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Create Templates (View Layer)**

Create a directory called `templates` within the `books` app, and inside that, create another directory called `books`.

1. Inside the `books/templates/books/` directory, create a file `book_list.html`:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Bookstore</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Books Available in Our Store</h1>
       <ul>
           {% for book in books %}
               <li>
                   <h2>{{ book.title }}</h2>
                   <p>Author: {{ book.author }}</p>
                   <p>{{ book.description }}</p>
                   <p><strong>Price:</strong> ${{ book.price }}</p>
                   <p><em>Published on: {{ book.published_date }}</em></p>
               </li>
           {% endfor %}
       </ul>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

---

### **Step 7: Set Up URL Routing**

1. **Create a `urls.py` file in the `books` app** (if it doesn’t exist already), and add the route for the book list view:

   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from . import views

   urlpatterns = [
       path('', views.book_list, name='book_list'),
   ]
   ```

2. In the `bookstore_project/urls.py` file, include the `books` app's URLs:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('', include('books.urls')),  # Include books URLs
   ]
   ```

---

### **Step 8: Run the Development Server**

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Access the Project**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the list of books.
   - To manage books through Django admin, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials.

---

### **Step 9: Sample Data (Optional)**

You can add books either through the admin interface or by using Django's shell.

1. **Access Django Shell**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell
   ```

2. **Create some sample books**:
   ```python
   from books.models import Book
   Book.objects.create(
       title="The Great Gatsby",
       author="F. Scott Fitzgerald",
       description="A novel about the American dream.",
       price=10.99,
       published_date="1925-04-10"
   )
   Book.objects.create(
       title="1984",
       author="George Orwell",
       description="A dystopian novel about totalitarianism.",
       price=8.99,
       published_date="1949-06-08"
   )
   ```

---

### **Step 10: Layered Architecture Breakdown**

In this bookstore project, we use the **MVC** pattern translated into **MTV** by Django:

- **Model (Data Layer)**: Defined in `books/models.py`, where the database structure (i.e., `Book`) is managed.
- **View (Logic Layer)**: Defined in `books/views.py`, where the business logic resides (i.e., fetching books and passing data to the template).
- **Template (Presentation Layer)**: Defined in `books/templates/books/book_list.html`, which is responsible for rendering the HTML view of the books list.

The project follows **Layered Architecture**:
- **Data Layer**: Models (e.g., `Book`) interact with the database.
- **Logic Layer**: Views fetch data, process it (if needed), and prepare it for the template.
- **Presentation Layer**: Templates display the data in a user-friendly format.

### **Project Structure**

Here’s the project directory structure:

```
bookstore_project/
├── books/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── books/
│   │       └── book_list.html

### **Conclusion**

You have successfully created a **Bookstore Django Project** that follows the **MVC design pattern** (Model-View-Controller) with a **Layered Architecture**. This structure allows you to easily scale and manage the application as it grows. You can expand this project by adding features like:

- User authentication (login, register).
- A cart and checkout system.
- Search functionality for books.
- Pagination for listing books.
